# Weaver Solver

Weaver Solver is an application designed to solve weaver puzzles. 
These puzzles involve getting from one word to another in the minimum number of moves, whilst only changing one letter at a time. 
These puzzles can be found at https://wordwormdormdork.com.

# Installation

Currently no install wizard exists for this project, you will have to pull the repository locally and open in unity to access and run.

# Usage

When running the application you will see 2 panels of 4 letters, similar to the Weaver website.
Begin typing to enter the start and target words for your desired puzzle.
Once you have typed both words, click the 'solve puzzle' button at the bottom of the screen.
You will be sent to another screen containing the solution. This screen will be blank if no solution is found.
You can drag vertically using your mouse to see each word in the solution.
Hit 'reset solver' to return to the entry screen and solve another puzzle!

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, please raise an issue for any major changes you wish to make and we can discuss further.
Please make sure to add/update unit tests too!
If you find any solutions that are wrong, please flag the start/target word as an issue and this will be investigated further.
Any incorrect answers are likely to be due to missing words in the word list (I couldn't find the exact list of accepted words, so I made my own which may be flawed)

# Unit tests

Unit tests will be added/updated as the project evolves, but no instructions exist for these currently...
